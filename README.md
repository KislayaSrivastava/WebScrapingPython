# WebScrapingPython
My Collection of WebScraping Codes with Python Libraries

This is my first attempt at web Scraping websites. I have been dabbling with python and working to improve my programming skills. 
The code snippets are specific to a particular website and based on a training course i took with "Jordan Sauchuk". 

Snippets are from scrapy, BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 
The Python version is 3.8 and the IDE was Spyder4 running on Anaconda Individual Edition. 

Please feel free to use these codes in your programs. I request you to provide an acknowledgement to my repository if you are using my codes. 

Happy Coding and learning Python.
